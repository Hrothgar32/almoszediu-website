*** What's this blog all about
To share the love for the one and only OS, Emacs of course. Well, not entirely.
It will contain random snippets of thought, both professional and
unprofessional, so it will reflect my thoughts on the current state of certain
software projects which I discover. In the beginning this going to be a bit
self-centered, as it will also be a kind of "self-documentation" I suppose, but
this could change easily.
**** Implementation
I'm writing this whole website inside of Emacs, taking advantage of a couple
of wonderful things, built by wonderful people:
- [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is a static site generator written inside of Go. You can use various
  formats to edit the content of your website, but the most sensible choice is
  Markdown, because that's what Hugo is really optimized for. The advantages of
  this approach as opposed to a non-static website is that the only HTTP request
  happens when the user loads in the page, making databases unneccesary, and
  making the whole website a lot faster.
- Markdown might be amazing, but every citizen of the Emacs realm knows, that
  org-mode is the shit. But how can you use org mode
  for your website, when you have to use markdown? [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] to the rescue! This
  wonderful Emacs package not only enables you to convert your org thoughts to
  Markdown, but also has the ability to export a single subtree into it's own
  post, making possible to write all of your blogposts in a single place, taking
  advantage of various org-mode tricks (*or so am I told, I actually still don't
  know very much about them*). See for yourselves:
 
  [[/images/org-mode-big-brain.png]]

  Amazing isn't it? Well, I have to learn much more about this org thing, to
  take advantage of it, but it's sure easier updating the Github page
  of the website, when it's only one measly file.
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]. Well of course we cannot forgot the star of this evening, the
  whole reason I'm going far and beyond in my static website setup. But it is
  totally worth it. In the near future, there will be posts about my workflow,
  and all the pain and suffering which came because of it, but it's all possible
  thanks to hlissner's efforts. If you're still using Vim, Spacemacs or use
  Emacs, but you're not sure how to configure it yourself, give this distro a
  spin, I'm sure you'll get something out of it.

**** Future
I'm planning to write a Spotify frontend for Emacs, because I'm too lazy to
switch workspaces to do such a trivial task, so yeah, instead of relying on some
wonderfully written programs, like [[https://github.com/Rigelutte/spotify-tui][spotify-tui]], I'm wondering of a wild path,
and write my first Emacs Lisp package. This thing is one of the reasons I
started this blog, because I thought it would be fun to document the whole
process, maybe some fortunate soul will learn from my mistakes.

:END:
Time and time again we hear about how ludicrously awesome Org is, and how should
we use it for everything, from scheduling tasks to taking notes at university
and the like. Since currently I'm not going back to Uni any time soon, I will
try mainly to take advantage of the former feature.

*** Agenda and other types of sorcery
The agenda minibuffer could be called your "productivity hub", since from there
you can access your tags and TODO's, the former categoryzing your tasks, the
latter than visualizing them. To bring it up, you type:

One of the challenges of starting a blog like this is to add a commenting
mechanism in order to connect with your audience. There are many options
available, but today I'll be explaining why I've chosen Remark, what are it's
particular advantages which make me choose it over other options, and how did I
set it up on my site. This
particular guide is aimed primarily toward fellow Hugo users, but I think it can
be followed by others as well, due to the way I hacked it into my blog.
*** The competition
**** [[https://disqus.com][Disqus]]
 Let's get the elephant out of the room, shall we? Disqus is easy to set up, easy to use, and comes built in with Hugo, moreover
 you can set it up for free! Well, when something is too good to be true, it
 usually isn't. Disqus comes with advertisements, which it displays on your
 website and these ads may be totally out of touch with your actual content, for
 example:
 [[/images/disqus-ads.png]]
 Yikes, disques-sting! So yeah, your blog may be filled with tabloid crap,
 unless you pay $10 a month, which for me, as a student, is a little bit much.
 Moreover, Disqus not only shows ads to your readers, but [[https://chrislema.com/killed-disqus-commenting/][also tracks them in a
 parasitic way to sell their data,]] and the gateway might be your blog.
**** [[https://staticman.net/][Staticman]]
Staticman is a free and open source project which aims to bring form integration
to fully static websites. The cool thing about this is that you can
integrate it to your free to host GitHub pages site, because of the generous
support by [[https://snipcart.com/][Snipcart]]. Because of it's open source nature, you can even host it on
your site if you're so inclined.
What's the deal breaker then? It's FOSS, it doesn't poke around in your
business, why didn't I choose this? Well, it seemed to me a bit... lacking, not
as pretty as Remark. It also lacks the social integration and avatars used
by other comment engines.

[[/images/staticman.png]]
**** [[https://utteranc.es][Utterances]]
"A lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues." Sounds amazing! But not
so much for me. Don't get me wrong, I love you fellow nerds, but I think the
choice should be given to you, if you want the world to see your lovely face
next to your comment, or not. It might be useful for some of you though, who
want the advantages of GitHub pages with additional GitHub goodness. It's a
creative and elegant solution, I'll have to give it that.

[[/images/utterances.png]]
**** [[https://commento.io/][Commento]]
Commento has a very nice business model, and I think it proves, that open-source
can be turned into a business just as easily as proprietary applications. It
also received $19,200 from the Mozzilla foundations, which shows its
seriousness, I think. This comment engine can also be self hosted with Docker so
I think it really comes down to personal preference, if you choose this or
Remark. I might try it out in the future, because it supports many of the
features, which were important to me. If you ask me, why I've chosen Remark, I
would say that because it gave me more Redditesque vibes, to be honest.

[[/images/commento.png]]
*** [[https://github.com/umputun/remark42][Remark itself]]
Well I've could have gone over the whole "Comments alternatives" part of the
Hugo docs, but I chose to cover just those which I was considering. The main
things, that ultimately lead me to choose Remark were:
- it's free and open source
- self-hosted option
- OAuth2 features easily enabled through it's docker-compose file
- RSS for you, flamewar warriors
- it looks like Reddit
It's self-hosted which for me, as a do-everything-yourself, Emacs loving madman
is acceptable, even desirable, but you might have different needs, or don't want
to be bothered by hosting a blog on a VPS. I won't be going into VPS hosting,
because that is beyond the scope of this blogpost, just know, that the
alternatives listed above don't need self-hosting.
I won't be posting pictures about it, because you can check it out right under
the article.
Let's talk about how did I set it up though?

*** Setup, part I:  your ingredients
**** 1 teaspoon of Docker
 
  *Shell commands for Ubuntu-boys (also for Debian-boomers)*

  I assume that you use version 16.04 or higher of Ubuntu or a distribution
  based off of Ubuntu. My server runs on
  version 18.04 which seems to be the most prevalent version in hosting as of
  now.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
  #+END_SRC

  *Shell commands for Arch-mages*
 
  Well I've done some toy projects on Arch Linux, but I don't know if it's very
  suitable for server usage, because of it's bleeding edge nature.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose
  #+END_SRC

  *Shell commands for Fedora-fanatics*
 
  I'm not an expert on Fedora, but the Docker guys say, that you should have a
  version of minimum Fedora 30. I mainly copied the commands from their site, so
  you lazy bastards won't have to open another tab, so take these with a grain
  of salt.
 
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
  #+END_SRC
  The next step is to enable the Docker service through systemd:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo systemctl start docker
  #+END_SRC

  Another cool thing would be to add your user to the docker group. Without
  this, you'd have to run docker commands with sudo, or worse, as the root user,
  so I think it's time you show the server that you're a big boy now:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo usermod -aG docker *your_username*
  #+END_SRC

  After this, you should be able to use the docker commands which I'll be using.
  Sweet!

**** 1 cup of nginx
 
  Back when I started to play around with Python, I couldn't understand why
  you'd need a reverse proxy, or a general purpose HTTP server for that matter.
 
  Nginx does the wonderful thing of allowing multiple applications to connect
  to the world using the same port. Why's that a good thing? It leaves fewer
  points of attack for malicious users and other monsters under your bed, and
  let's you easily configure subdomains for your various sites. Heck it even functions as a load balancer, to redirect traffic to other servers, if
  you have the need (I don't. Yet.). I haven't used Apache, so I can't give
  advice on that.

  *Shell commands for Ubuntu-boys (also for Debian-boomers)*

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    #+END_SRC

   *Shell commands for Arch-wizards*
  
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo pacman -S nginx
#+END_SRC

*Shell commands for Fedora-fanatics*
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo dnf install nginx
#+END_SRC
Now that the software is fine and dandy, it's time to enable it through good ol'
systemd:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
#+END_SRC

The latter command is for times when you want to reboot your server.

If we want to communicate with the outside world, we need to enable nginx on our
HTTP and HTTPS ports (assuming that you want to have/have an SSL certificate).
This can be done with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ufw allow 'NGINX HTTP_ALL'
#+END_SRC
Doing this step on Arch might not be as trivial unfortunately, unless you did
the firewall setup. If you didn't you might want to check it out on the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Firewalls][Arch
Wiki]], which does a way more detailed and practical guide on it, than I could.
**** 1 gear of Certbot
Well, you actually will need all of Certbot's capabilities here, but don't worry,
this one's pretty easy to install! This program will provide an SSL certificate
for your website and the Remark server, which are required especially if you
will have visitors sending comments to that server. Even if you already have an
SSL certificate for your main domain, the server needs to be under it as well,
otherwise  your browser will complain about the website operating with HTTPS and
HTTP together.

*Shell commands for Ubuntu-boys (Debian-boomers can skip the updating steps)*

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
#+END_SRC

*Shell commands for Arch-wizards*

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo pacman -S certbot certbot-nginx
#+END_SRC

*Shell commands for Fedora-fanatics*

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo dnf install certbot certbot-nginx
#+END_SRC
*** Setup, part II: setting up the subdomain
Technically, you could set up Remark42 without a subdomain, the official method
is using one, and it actually isn't that difficult to set it up.
First, you need to go to your domain registrar's (the company from which you
bought your domain name) website, and on the page on which you can see your
settings for that particular domain, go to the DNS options.

[[/images/namecheap.png]]

[[/images/godaddy.png]]

On that page, you will want to add a new A record. For the "name" or "host"
option you want to change the default @ character to the name of your subdomain,
and in the "value" section you write the public IP address of your server.
[[/images/examople.png]]
*** Setup, part III: running Remark42 via docker
First and foremost, you'll need a *docker-compose.yml* file. This basically
tells Docker what is the base program, and you will provide some details on how
to set it up. I will provide an example configuration here:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
version: '2'

services:
    remark:
        build: .
        image: umputun/remark42:latest
        container_name: "remark42"
        hostname: "remark42"
        restart: always

        logging:
            driver: json-file
            options:
                max-size: "10m"
                max-file: "5"

        # uncomment to expose directly (no proxy)
        #ports:
        #  - "80:8080"

        environment:
            - REMARK_URL=
            - SECRET=
            - SITE=
            - STORE_BOLT_PATH=/srv/var/db
            - BACKUP_PATH=/srv/var/backup
            - DEBUG=true
            - AUTH_GOOGLE_CID
            - AUTH_GOOGLE_CSEC
            - AUTH_GITHUB_CID=
            - AUTH_GITHUB_CSEC=
            - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CID
            - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CSEC
            - AUTH_DISQUS_CID
            - AUTH_DISQUS_CSEC
            # - ADMIN_PASSWD=password
        volumes:
            - ./var:/srv/var
#+END_SRC

You can leave most of these alone, but you *have to* give values to some
of these options:
- REMARK_URL

  This is the URL of the remark server, and it will be your domain name
  prefixed with your subdomain: https://remark.exampledomain.com
- SECRET

  This has to be a unique string. Many backend applications have these for
  security reasons.
- SITE
 
  This is the ID of your website, which runs Remark42, you just give it a
  string, which has to matched in your HTML snippet down to line: *example_id*
Apart from these, you have to provide an authentication method by which your
user's can identify themselves. This can be done through Facebook, Disqus,
Google and GitHub. I'm going to show you how you can obtain GitHub OAuth
authentication, the process is similar other social media applications.
1) Go to https://github.com/settings/developers and click on "New OAuth App"
  [[/images/github-oauth.png]]
2) Fill in the form. Application name can be whatever your heart desires, the
   *Homepage URL* will take the form: https://remark.exampledomain.com.

   The *Application Callback URL* is the URL by which your Remark42 server
   authenticates to GitHub, and will take the form:
   https://remark.exampledomain.com/auth/github/callback
3) After you've done this, you can access your application's *Client ID* and
   *Client Secret* copy these to their corresponding (*AUTH_GITHUB_CID*,
   *AUTH_GITHUB_CSEC*) properties in your *docker-compose.yaml* file.

The [[https://github.com/umputun/remark42#github-auth-provider][Remark42 README file]] is actually really easy to follow regarding OAuth
access, I just wrote the process here so you don't have to open other pages.
Regardless, we can finally start our Remark42 server with Docker!

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

After this is done, you want to find out the IP address of your Docker container
to later forward to it the traffic coming from your subdomain.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' remark42
#+END_SRC
*** Setup, part IV: nginx magic
The default way to your nginx config is: */etc/nginx/sites-available/default*.
Open it with your favorite text editor, (don't forget to sudo) and add a new
*server block* similar to this one:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
server {
   server_name remark.exampledomain.com;
   location / {
         proxy_pass http://your_docker_ip:8080;
   }
}
#+END_SRC
This tells nginx to reroute every incoming request to your docker container, which is a
wonderful thing, because you don't have to open additional ports on your
firewall.
After you edit and save your config file, restart nginx:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
#+END_SRC
*** Setup, part V: Certbot certificates
Now you will get SSL certificates for your Remark server, and if you haven't
done it yet, for your website as well.
It couldn't be any easier than typing in:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo certbot --nginx
#+END_SRC
Just follow it's instructions, they are really straightforward. I'd advice to
set rerouting to HTTPS by default.
After completing Cerbot's instructions, if you visit https://remark.exampledomain.com/web, you should see
something similar to this:
[[/images/demo.png]]
*** Setup, part VI: Getting it to the Front!
We've done all this good work, now we just have to make it appear under our
posts! To do that, you'll have to visit your Hugo project's main folder (the one
with *config.toml* in it) and get the
*/themes/--your_theme_name--/layouts/posts/single.html* file (I assume every
Hugo themes directory structure's similar).
This is not a regular HTML file, but one with template engine markup. Don't get
intimidated by it, but copy in this snippet, BEFORE the final *{{- end -}}* tag:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
<script>
  var remark_config = {
    host: , // hostname of remark server, same as REMARK_URL in backend config,
    site_id: , //same as the ID you set in the docker-compose.yaml file
    components: ['embed'], // optional param; which components to load. default to ["embed"]
                    // to load all components define components as ['embed', 'last-comments', 'counter']
                    // available component are:
                    //     - 'embed': basic comments widget
                    //     - 'last-comments': last comments widget, see `Last Comments` section below
                    //     - 'counter': counter widget, see `Counter` section below
    max_shown_comments: 10, // optional param; if it isn't defined default value (15) will be used
    theme: 'dark', // optional param; if it isn't defined default value ('light') will be used
    locale: 'en' // set up locale and language, if it isn't defined default value ('en') will be used
  };

  (function(c) {
    for(var i = 0; i < c.length; i++){
      var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
      s.src = remark_config.host + '/web/' +c[i] +'.js';
      s.defer = true;
      (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
    }
  })(remark_config.components || ['embed']);
</script>
#+END_SRC

Complete the *host* and *site_id* sections with the instructions left in the comments.
Now you only have one last thing to do insert this little snippet of HTML where
you see fit on your HTML page:
#+BEGIN_SRC HTML
<div id="remark42"></div>
#+END_SRC
*** Final thoughts
If you've made it to the end of it, and now have a new shiny comment box under
your posts: congratulations! You've made another place on the interwebs to start
a flame war. All jokes aside, I hope I could help with this little tutorial. For
more details and documentation on Remark42 visit it's GitHub page: https://github.com/umputun/remark42.

** DONE Our insatiable need to consume content on YouTube :rant:consumerism:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: need-to-feed
:EXPORT_DATE: 2020-05-19
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :featuredImage "/images/watching.jpg"
:END:

Every passing day, this corona thing makes me consume more and more online
content, in order to avoid facing my responsibilites and pass the time somehow.
Our generation (young adults in their late teens, early twenties) praises
itself in avoiding the pitfall of television. We argue, that because we opt
out of the control of a television network, we control the content we watch and
it's not the other way around, which is how the boomers are fooled by their
black boxes. I'd actually argue against this.
*** YouTube is no better than your average cable subscription
Now hear me out. I can't speak for everyone, that is for sure, I'm just talking
about my personal experience, and the things which I have noticed among my
friends.

Most of the time we seek something easy to consume, easy to digest. We aimlessly
wander around the landscape of YouTube, following it's recommendations, watching
our feed be filled with creators about whom we might have forget about who they
actually were, but we subscribed anyways because of one particular video, at the
end of which we were kindly asked to like, subscribe, hit the bell notification,
the usual drill. Isn't this familiar? Isn't this how we... watched TV? Aimless,
zombie like state, when we just want to be entertained, want to avoid our own
thoughts, problems and more. To me, this platform in this regard is not better,
but actually worse. At least, when we were watching TV, we were struck odd by
stupidity of advertisements. Speaking of which...
*** The advent of in-content advertisement. Improvise, adapt, overcome
If you read this blog, you probably know, what AdBlock is. It was born out of a
simple need: purify the web. In the early days, of which I wasn't really that
much a part of (we got internet at my house 2008-ish?), but even at the end of it, the internet was a Wild West. There was little to no corporate interest, just a
bunch of nerds like myself launching their websites, and the tech industry
producing it's first couple of giants, which the world watched with peering
eyes, but weren't of the significance or importance as they are today. It was a
naive and liberating place, not controlled by two or three big companies, like
it is today. Online forums, dozens of proto-social media candidates, sprawling
communities. Even as a child I wandered around the forums of the only MMORPG
that could be played on my Pentium4 computer (Metin2) and made some good friends
on IRC chats.

Everything changed, when the advertisement nations attacked. In the second part
of the 2010-s, YouTube became a sophisticated enough platform for more serious
advertisement. That is good enough for showing advertisement for average or
casual YouTube viewers, but you don't really need a whole lot of tech savvyness
to install an AdBlocker. So channels started to directly work directly with
sponsors, which was and is more profitable for them and more direct and genuine
for the consumer, being a better advertisement platform.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing in my opinion. A good thing in the
sense that a content creator does not rely solely on the mystical YouTube-AI
which deems videos advertiser unfriendly left and right, but a bad thing in the
sense that the same content creator becomes dependent on other, more direct
third parties. This may or may not push them into accepting contracts in which
not the ads are the means of producing videos, by financing this endeavor, but
the videos become the shell to show these ads. This trend is not as strong as it
is in the case of mainstream television, as individuals are harder to corrupt
than established TV-stations.

This shell state however is getting more and more popular because the way to
fame and views (which leads to revenue) is through controversy and clickbait.

*** TOP 10 WAYS I REACT TO WATER BEING WET (NUMBER 7 WILL SHOCK YOU)
We're all way too familiar with this. All caps title, a surprised or curious
face of our content producer and a topic which at the surface level might even
be of interest to us. We click on it, watch the whole ten minute video, which
takes ages to reach to a conclusion, which isn't at all groundbreaking in the
slightest sense. We feel nothing at all. We learned nothing at all. We might
have smiled or even laughed at some jokes, but we weren't even entertained while
watching this thing. There was nothing of particular value put into it, which
couldn't have been said or done by one of our friends next to a beer.

This shallowness might not be intentional at all. But it makes the most sense,
from a content producer's perspective. If you're doing this professionally, and
rely on sponsorships it simply doesn't really make sense to make very long, hard
to produce videos. One off sponsor segments are worth more in high quantity,
shorter videos, than many sponsor segments in a long one.

Long, quality videos take a lot of work, and a lot energy to make. Not only
this, but in order to make it watchable, you have to fill it with audio-visual
stimulants, because we've been spoon-fed with these, just like with sugar. Take
for example the Kurzgesagt channel. It is a truly amazing and noteworthy
channel, but would it be interesting to so many people without it's top notch
animation? What if the audio quality would remain the same, the writing the
same, and only the scope of visual representation would change, without reducing
the amount of information. Would it be as successful, as it is now? And again,
I'm not against these animations, I think they are wonderful, I'm just pointing
out why they're a symptom of our instant gratification filled world.This
is not necessarily only the content producer's fault.

So far I've been pointing at the platform itself along with it's creators, but it would be foolish to
ignore the responsibility of the customer from this whole ordeal.
*** The numbness of the mind
I have noticed on myself, that the year long exposure to instant gratification
web-media has made me... dumber. My reading comprehension hasn't diminished
significantly, but analyzing and understanding highly structural, complex and
self-referencing texts has become harder for me. Another thing which I think was
hurt by today's social media landscape is my ability to pay attention at
university classes. We've been accustomed to getting new types of impulses every
few minutes with a different topic, and getting your brain bombarded with
something substantially new and complex feels dangerous, in a way.

One of my favorite channels is [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkzHxIcfoEr69MWBdo0ppg][Cuck Philosophy]]. He mostly analyzes twentieth
century philosopher's in a thorough way, outlining their main ideas or
contributions to general philosophic thought but also bringing forth their
cultural significance. As much as I enjoy and like these videos, I often find
myself not being able to reconstruct the train of thought presented to me. He
does not use catchy thumbnails, does not cracks jokes, he makes content for the
sake of content and education. It may also be a factor, that I'm not a philosophy
major, nor am I very educated in this field, but I firmly believe, that had I
continued my habit of reading (literature, and more complex non-fiction books,
not those self-help improvement crapfests [about which I might write an article
in the future]), I'd be more capable of receiving and processing information,
along with a more structural train of thought.

*** Final remarks
Though it may seem weird after the things written above, I truly believe that
YouTube is one of the greatest platform's in existence. I've learned many useful
skills, and encountered knowledge that otherwise might never have reached me.

Ultimately it is our responsibility too as consumers, to be conscious about our time
and attention, and give it to those creations which deserve it. Also, there's
nothing wrong with being lighthearted or watching cat videos, it's just the
amount of those videos that you watch daily, that should be alarming.

I think the best way for monetizing content and appreciating creative work is through
direct crowdfunding. This topic will receive it's own post.

Stay safe and read something cool!

Due to their inherently commercial nature, video games have not enjoyed for many
years the amount of prestige that movies, and fiction books had and have.  This
trend has begin in recent years, and that is because video games have reached a
*threshold maturity-level* fairly quickly.
*** From tech demo to art
If we're being honest, every medium which now we take for granted, began it's
life as a tech demo. There could be made an exception here with cave paintings,
but I would rescue my argument with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)][bicameralism]] which will get it's own blog
post down the line. I would define a medium which can hold art as a deliberate
and conscious method to create an object of beauty or conveyor of human emotions
which could of course show our longing for the transcendent or explain our origins for that
matter.

My main argument here is that the first written records of the Sumerians weren't the
tales of Gilgames, but rather the discovery, that hey, if we make a system out
of symbols, and carve it in a rock, we can store information. The cave paintings
held similar functions initially. The horns made out of bone signaled a
successful hunt, or scared off animals, and eventually striked fear in the
hearts of the enemies. These were pragmatic functions, but we humans, are a
weird bunch of apes, and find new uses for just about every piece of technology
we use, just for the sake of our amusement or willingness to escape our world.

The tech demo for the video game was of course Pong. There might have been other
precursors, but I'm not a historian but a mere blogger, and this was to most
notable. It was released in 1972, and truly revolutionized the world of
entertainment. By then, the invention of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography#Film_cinematography][Lumière]] brothers was well regarded
and prominent, having wonderful artists like Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky
and Alfred Hitchkock, and music and literature have been shaping the our
not-so-bicameral minds for milleniums. This unassuming little piece of work
consisted of two vertical bars, tossing a ball between each other. Hell, I could
play with cardboard cut-out stick figures today, and it would be more quality
entertainment, but everything has to start somewhere.

The next natural progression were the RPG type games.

:END:
Tis strange, but it is certainly true to some extent: being on trains is like being in another plane of existence: it is a separate social place, with ever changing, ever moving background. Because of the vast space it encompasses, it does not feel like a vehicle, it feels like another moving world.
*** The Feeling of a New Start
Every time I embark on a train trip, I feel like I'm going to start my life over, like a hopeful lad who tries he's fortune in the New World. To be completely oblivious to your past, to not be crippled by anxiety of tomorrow: this is what I mean.
And this isn't only the case when I visit a new city, this happens every time I travel beetween my home town and my university town.
*** Being slow isn't all that bad
Also, in a perverted way, I enjoy the fact the trains here in Romania are so awfully slow. You can truly get into the state where you are completely disconnected from your everyday woes and problems, and could also get an outsider perspective on them.
For example, I'm anxious about talking to my landlord, because my roommates have
moved out, and I don't know if I can keep the apartment for the summer, if I'm
the only one paying for it. But here I am, fantasizing about getting a job in
Italy or Germany, just for the sake of getting to know the historical parts of Europe.
*** Train-friendships
Train friendships are a magical phenomena. Well of course, we all look at our
phones, but once in a while we just can't help but to strike  a conversation
with the person sitting one meter away from us. Well, I'm not doing that just
right know, because I'm writing, but if I have that kind of traveling mate, it
really could make the trip go so much easier.
The most beautiful things about these friendships are the fact that they only
exist on the train. Most probably you will never speak again with this person,
nor will you see them ever again. It's  a precious magic, and we should
appreciate the fact that it exists. After one of you arrives at his or her
station you say goodbye, and after a  few minutes it will seem like that you
have only dreamed this whole thing, and your mind is playing tricks on you. It's
kind of like festival-friendships, with the difference that your background
changes and moves without you taking drugs, which is pretty cost effective, if
you ask me!
*** Nature
This also makes me appreciate more the Transylvanian landscape, which I have to
say, it's pretty gorgeous every time. I've been on the DiscoverEU program with
my pal last year, and I have to say, there was rarely a time when we were in awe
because of the landscape we saw. The Czech Republic was especially bland, but
the boring crown has to go the Netherlands: at first it was pretty astonishing
to see just how FLAT can a piece of country get if it really sets itself to it,
but after that initial reaction our emotions were replaced with the *meh*. Allow
me to be patriotic about the nature of my homeland, because it is truly beautiful.
*** Trains make us perpetual children
I think I'm drawn to trains because me and my parents used to travel exclusively
by train when I was little. My father didn't see the need for a car, nor were we in the
situation financially to get one. So we "trained", and boi, I don't really
regret it! My favourite types of trains were the ones with a second floor. I
called them "froggy trains" for some reason, and I don't really know why.
I don't remember sadly much of my pre-school childhood, which was a happy period
of my life, but traveling by train somehow gives me some flashbacks about the
things I've felt as a little human.
*** Books
Reading on trains is the best. Especially if you're surrounded by fellow
students or just people who have business in some other city. This is sadly only
possible on long distance trains. Local trains often smell of piss, and it's
travelers listen to garbage music loudly, without headphones, and drink beer out
of plastic bottles.
But setting that aside, these kinds of trips give the possibility of a
meditative book reading experience. My favourite reads on train were Murakami
Haruki's short stories, and "The Red Haired Woman" by Orhan Pamuk.
*** Final remarks
I've been a lifelong train fan, and always will be. It is my favorite mean of
transportation, a strange mixture of a vehicle and a social space where you can
be who you want to be, free from the pressure of the fast-paced reality which
suffocates many of us from day to day. Or I'm just too poetic about it, and
should get my lazy ass to finish driving school. Who knows? Maybe you do. Give
me your input on this!

I'm mainly a beer guy, to be completely honest. There are some situations
however, when a good wine could enlighten my spirit in more appropiate ways.
That's how it is when listening to Bauhaus, at 2 AM, alone at home. Other times
I'd feel bad for being a loner like this, but thanks to the internet, and my
keyboard, this is not the case.
The gloomy, gothic athmosphere blends itself well with the fruitiness of the
white Tokaj wine. Wine is the mind palace juice.
*** What is beer then?
Beer is many things, if you ask me. But it's a drink that needs company, either
in the beauty of other human beings or a good, simple and fulfilling meal, a
home-made carefully prepared burger I suppose.
If you're out at the pub, beer is the way to go. In the summer heat a good
Pilsner or a sophisticated Red Ale soothes the warm waves and sweat and chills
the mind or gives energy and bravery for the last couple of moshpits left of the
festival day.
If there's a party in your house, then it's 50/50 beer or hard liquor, but
mostly cocktails, because we're not barbarians.
*** The blood of gods
Wine has a special part in Hungarian culture in general, and we're more of a
wine folk to be completely honest. Our nation has no extensive beer history like
the germanic people, and most of the functions I've described above were
designated to the wine. Weddings, pubs, funeral feasts. We have folk songs about
guarding the grapes, collecting them and enjoying it as well. The best vineyards
are in Hungary though, not in Transylvania, so maybe I could get a pass.
The Greeks thought that only barbarians would drink unwatered the blood of gods,
and we Hungarians most have thought the same, because "fröccs" (watered down
wine) is really prevalent in Hungary. I might be a barbarian then, because I'm
either drinking it as it is, or grab a beer.
*** The prestige of wine
Grape is a sensitive plant, and a good wine needs nurture, experience and
knowledge. Not that beer is trivial, but you could get a decent beer much more
easily, than a drinkable, good wine. That's what primarily gives wine such
prestige, as I presume. This and the general snobism and elitism of the French,
the intellectual and cultural center of Europe, for hundreds of years.
*** British post-punk in the mixture
This kind of music is very subtle, experimenting, noble and gentle at the same
time. I could describe the experience of drinking wine with similar adjectives,
and many of you might agree with this.
I've been introduced to this kind of music by the dorky but super-smart friend,
which every one us has, and we need to appreciate them more.
The wine part I'm probably faking for the appearance of intellectual superiority
like every snob, but at least I'm admiting it.

Enjoy it while it lasts!

This was my first Robert Eggers movie, and I'm truly interested in the
director's filmography after this.
Don't be mistaken, this wasn't a pleasent watch. But just like the curiosity of
Tom Howard in this feature, so was mine going further and further into the
depths of this beatiful monstrosity. Not because of the intriguing plot, or
life-like characters, but because of the somber melancholy and holiness, which
perpetrates throughout the film.

The story begins with Pattinson and Defoe arriving at the lighthouse, somewhere
along the shores of New England, and the two begin to accomodate themselves, get
to know each other, and face the hardships of being locked together along with
the harsh weather, lack of food and other human interactions. And that's about
it.

As they spiral more and more into chaos and insanity, the viewer finds himself questioning
the thing he has seen, the music becomes more and more threatening and he the
sense of time and the seemingly logical narrative becomes more and more questionable.
Was the old wickie toying with the lad all the time? Or perhaps our boy Tommy is
just a vile and corrupt man, who he was or was percieved in his past? It's hard
to tell, and the question remains open.

Speaking lengthily about this feature is a futile task: it must be experienced,
seen heard, feared and felt.

It's no big suprise to me, that this wasn't featured in mainstream cinemas: this
is an artist's film and omage to human desires fears and longing towards
something unattainable. I have to watch it a couple more times, to truly get my
head around this... now I hear the echoes of the tragic wickies' jolly song.

Bong Joon Ho has definitely brought some fresh and new perspectives into
Hollywood, as seen in his latest movie, Parasites, but many of us have known his
other great work Snowpiercer, which has also stirred some still waters, back
in 2013.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! You have been warned.

*** Synopsis
The premise is quite unique, and thought provoking, in and on itself: global
warming has become so rampant, that the scientists of Earth have decided that
the only solution to stopping it is artificially cooling down our planet with
the use of a special chemical which they released into the atmosphere. They
succeeded, but they were "winning too much" and actually cooled the Earth down
to such an extent that life has become threatened by a new and extreme Ice Age.
The last remnants of humanity boarded a train called the Snowpiercer, built by
millionaire genius Wilford, but the price of admission meant that only the very
rich could afford a ticket to salvation. Unfortunately neither the movie, nor
the series explains the significance of their wealth in a society without banks,
companies or stock markets, but unfortunately this is but the smallest
inconvinience.

The base of the Netflix adaptation remains the same, but fortunately the plot
differs quite a lot. I don't mean that it's better, in fact I'm going to make a
point of it that it's not, but at least the showrunners didn't give us a remake
of a mere seven year old movie. They delivered instead a rather entertaining but
woefully mediocre television series about solving crimes, getting betrayed,
being beaten up and making grand unnecessary speeches. You know the drill folks.

*** Ideology vs cheap symbolism
Soo... the idiological flames of the original movie were handed over to Netflix,
but do the fires of Vesta still burn? It could be sad, that the series tackles
societal issues, the divide between rich and poor and unprecendented corporate
and individual greed. The problem with this is the main  problem that permeates
the whole season: shallowness. The opposing factions are strawmanned essentially,
with one  dimensional motivations and moral compasses. The Tailies apart from
Trevor from GTA V are all noble and fraternal people, and the First Class
passangers are essentially a parody of oligarch, out of touch elites who can
only complain, boast about their wealth, and play pitiful mini-politics between
each other.

At the end of the season, Layton's revolution becomes succesful, but not without
heavy casualties. It really bothered me, that shots showing the bloodbath in the
Nightcar were overly long, and even slowed down, jumping from person to person as if the director screamed at
us: "LOOK AT THE HORRORS OF WAR! LOOK AT THEIR SUFFERING! LOOK HOW SAD THE
HEROES ARE!". It honestly would have had a much more profund impact on me, if
the camera zoomed out for a few seconds, and showed the battlefield as a morbid
still life. Show, don't tell!

*** Acting
The problem is further deepened by the fact that the lead actor who plays Andre
Layton ([[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4377526/?ref_=tt_cl_t2][Daveed Diggsk]]) is simply uninspiring as a leader. A good example for
this would be the scene in which he has to sacrifice the imprisoned Tailies in
order to save the rest of the train. He looked and acted more like a confused
child who tries to lie to his mother, than a determined but morally conflicted
leader.

Luckily this couldn't be said about [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000124/?ref_=tt_cl_t1][Jennifer Connelly]], who delivers a believable
and likable character, whose humanity is much more apparent than the artificiality
of Daveed. She maintains the illusion of control, and is empathetic towards the
passangers, but is actually capable of necessary sacrifice and does not hesitate
to act. Miles ahead of the Mary Sue-like Layton, who flies from girl-to-girl
like an overdosed butterfly gives drier speeches than the Dead Sea.

As for the rest of the cast... well they deliver their generic characters in a
generic, but acceptable way. It ain't much, but it's honest work. One notable
exception would be [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2399383/?ref_=tt_cl_t12][Annalise Basso]], who played the morbid and spoilt LJ. She
shows many sides of the teen psyche and you often can't decide whether to hate
her, pity her or laugh with/at her. An actually well thought-out and developed
side character whose scenes were enjoyable and well acted.

*** The plot justifies the deeds...
If you ask me what the greatest sin of mass-produced Hollywood cinematography
is, this would be my first pick. Plot driven characters feel unnatural,
dishonest to themselves and the viewer and are very-very cheap.

Why did Layton
act towards Zarah as a slightly disgruntled friend, after she DIRECTLY pointed
out his love to the Jackboots, which resulted in her death?

When did Trevor from
GTA V become such a scheming snake when he was the most stubborn fighting
machine beforehand? Don't get me wrong, I don't expect characters to don't
develop, but this kind of sudden jumps in character development takes me out of
the immersion, and reminds me that I'm watching a TV Show, and I don't like
being reminded of the fact. If he wouldn't have been quite literally "put on
ice", for much of the season,  his arc would have made an interesting caveat.
Because it's easier to write a story with Deus Ex Bainfreezer, that is why!

*** Visuals
Finally, something redeemable! Being a small-budget first season Netflix show,
it didn't have much cash to burn on CGI which explains the relatively few
outside shots, but at least they don't feel very-very cheap. The interior
decorations looked majestic and the series as a whole is very "sci-fi looking".
My only complaint regarding this side of the story would be the cringe-worthy
comic book style introductions, with low FPS. Just because you include some
drawn frames, it doesn't become more edgy or artistic.
*** Conclusion
It seems like that I hated this show, but it really isn't the case. I just
expected more from it, and didn't meet my expectations after the masterfully
directed film with the same  title. The story, despite being forced on it's poor
subjects, was actually compelling, and I'm looking forward to find out info
about the supply train. It will remain my brain fast-food between binging more
demanding titles.

It's not the first day that I began to work on this project, but this day I felt
like I began to see my effort being worthwhile.

Shredbase is going to be a sort of metal band recommending site, which will base
it's recommendation on the r/metal subreddit.
*** Challenges
**** Natural language processing
Since my recommendations will be based on Reddit comments and posts, I need to
find a way to extract this information from the many English text and organize
it into links, pictures, names and numerical information.

Fortunately, the language of my choice for the backend is Python, which has many
libraries which can help me. I chose [[https://spacy.io/][spaCy]], since it's open source, has great
documentation and it's intuitive to use. Another advantage for it is it's great
[[https://course.spacy.io/en/][interactive tutorial]], which teaches me to use it from zero to hero.
The only other NLP solution that I've used was [[https://wit.ai][Wit.ai]], but that company has been
aquired by Facebook and it's not a library, but an API which brings in the
danger of data mining by a third party, and I'm not a fan of that.

I will probably try to achive something similar to it's *intent-entity* system,
but the exact implications will be in the future.
**** Database caching
It would be quite tedious to run the NLP program every time a user wants to find
similar metal bands to say, Metallica, so I plan to save the results in an SQL
Database. I'll probably use MariaDB and the effectiveness of the whole operation
will depend on the demand of the website.
**** Getting the data
Python to the rescue! Some really cool people have already written a wrapper for
the Reddit API called [[https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][PRAW]], which will help me tremendously. This wonderful tool
can extract comments, posts, upvotes, and everything you would need to get
Reddit data. Since I won't give away the gathered data to third parties, I think
I won't violate any Reddit guidelines.
**** Frontend
I'm more of a backend guy, and a terminal-lover but to a certain extent only. I
myself like nicely written, accessible UI-s with a good experience, so I will
try my best to write something enjoyable to use.

I will use React.JS as my frontend-framework, since I've worked with it before
(the [[https://movie.almoszediu.com][Media Server Project.]]), and work with it is an enjoyable and intuitive
experience. I'll probably use some free heavy metal font for logo, and animate
some simple flames around it.

The background will be black of course.
*** Progress (so far, and today)
**** API
I've outlined the skeleton of my API based on the first two functions of my
website:
- Recommend bands through a similar band.
- Recommend bands through a subgenre.
  Not particularly elegant, but it helps to keep the scope of the project
  manageable. Sometimes remote procedure call is all you need.
**** UI
I'm relearning React.js because the last time I've used it was some 2 years ago,
and many things have changed since. So... I shouldn't use Redux, Hooks are not a
buzzword anymore, and screw classes? I guess that's how we roll now.
**** NLP
I'm learning the spaCy library with their online interactive course, which is
quite good, but I'm also documenting my progress in an org file. The good thing
about Org mode is that you can execute code and view the results just like in
Jupiter Notebooks.
This way I'm gonna make myself a cookbook which will help me out if I'll forget
something along the development process. And believe me, I most certainly will
forget stuff.
*** Future
I've got some things on my plate right know, since I might begin some additional
projects very soon (some of them for clients), but I'm confident in my abilities
to realize this fun utility website. I hope it will be of great use to me, and
other metalheads as well.

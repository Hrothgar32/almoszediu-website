This was my first Robert Eggers movie, and I'm truly interested in the
director's filmography after this.
Don't be mistaken, this wasn't a pleasent watch. But just like the curiosity of
Tom Howard in this feature, so was mine going further and further into the
depths of this beatiful monstrosity. Not because of the intriguing plot, or
life-like characters, but because of the somber melancholy and holiness, which
perpetrates throughout the film.

The story begins with Pattinson and Defoe arriving at the lighthouse, somewhere
along the shores of New England, and the two begin to accomodate themselves, get
to know each other, and face the hardships of being locked together along with
the harsh weather, lack of food and other human interactions. And that's about
it.

As they spiral more and more into chaos and insanity, the viewer finds himself questioning
the thing he has seen, the music becomes more and more threatening and he the
sense of time and the seemingly logical narrative becomes more and more questionable.
Was the old wickie toying with the lad all the time? Or perhaps our boy Tommy is
just a vile and corrupt man, who he was or was percieved in his past? It's hard
to tell, and the question remains open.

Speaking lengthily about this feature is a futile task: it must be experienced,
seen heard, feared and felt.

It's no big suprise to me, that this wasn't featured in mainstream cinemas: this
is an artist's film and omage to human desires fears and longing towards
something unattainable. I have to watch it a couple more times, to truly get my
head around this... now I hear the echoes of the tragic wickies' jolly song.

            </div>Every passing day, this corona thing makes me consume more and more online content, in order to avoid facing my responsibilites and pass the time somehow. Our generation (young adults in their late teens, early twenties) praises itself in avoiding the pitfall of television. We argue, that because we opt out of the control of a television network, we control the content we watch and it&rsquo;s not the other way around, which is how the boomers are fooled by their black boxes.]]></description>

            </div>One of the challenges of starting a blog like this is to add a commenting mechanism in order to connect with your audience. There are many options available, but today I&rsquo;ll be explaining why I&rsquo;ve chosen Remark, what are it&rsquo;s particular advantages which make me choose it over other options, and how did I set it up on my site. This particular guide is aimed primarily toward fellow Hugo users, but I think it can be followed by others as well, due to the way I hacked it into my blog.]]></description>

            </div>What&rsquo;s this blog all about To share the love for the one and only OS, Emacs of course. Well, not entirely. It will contain random snippets of thought, both professional and unprofessional, so it will reflect my thoughts on the current state of certain software projects which I discover. In the beginning this going to be a bit self-centered, as it will also be a kind of &ldquo;self-documentation&rdquo; I suppose, but this could change easily.]]></description>

            </div>Tis strange, but it is certainly true to some extent: being on trains is like being in another plane of existence: it is a separate social place, with ever changing, ever moving background. Because of the vast space it encompasses, it does not feel like a vehicle, it feels like another moving world.
The Feeling of a New Start Every time I embark on a train trip, I feel like I&rsquo;m going to start my life over, like a hopeful lad who tries he&rsquo;s fortune in the New World.]]></description>

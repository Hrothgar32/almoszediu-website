It will contain random snippets of thought, both professional and unprofessional, so it will reflect my thoughts on the current state of certain software projects which I discover. In the beginning this going to be a bit self-centered, as it will also be a kind of “self-documentation” I suppose, but this could change easily.

You can use various formats to edit the content of the website, but the most sensible choice is Markdown, because that’s what Hugo is really optimized for. The advantages of this approach as opposed to a non-static website is that the only HTTP request happens when the user loads in the page, making databases unneccesary, and making the whole website a lot faster. Markdown might be amazing, but every citizen of the Emacs realm knows, that org-mode is the shit. So I’m writing new random But how can you use org mode for your website, when you have to use markdown? ox-hugo to the rescue! This wonderful Emacs package not only enables you to convert your org thoughts to Markdown, but also has the ability to export a single subtree into it’s own post, making possible to write all of your blogposts in a single place, taking advantage of various org-mode tricks (or so am I told, I actually still don’t know very much about them). See for yourselves: Amazing isn’t it? Well, I have to learn much more about this org thing, to take advantage of it, but it’s sure easier uploading updating the Github page of the website, when it’s only one measly file. Doom Emacs . Well of course we cannot forgot the star of this evening, the whole reason I’m going far and beyond in my static website setup. But it is totally worth it. In the near future, there will be posts about my workflow, and all the pain and suffering which came because of it, but it’s all possible thanks to hlissner’s efforts. If you’re still using Vim, Spacemacs or use Emacs, but you’re not sure how to configure it yourself, give this distro a spin, I’m sure you’ll get something out of it.

This thing is one of the reasons I started this blog, because I thought it would be fun to document the whole process, maybe some fortunate soul will learn from my mistakes.

We aimlessly wander around the landscape of YouTube, following it’s recommendations, watching our feed be filled with creators about whom we might have forget about who they actually were, but we subscribed anyways because of one particular video, at the end of which we were kindly asked to like, subscribe, hit the bell notification, the usual drill.

Improvise, adapt, overcome If you read this blog, you probably know, what AdBlock is. It was born out of a simple need: purify the web. In the early days, of which I wasn’t really that much a part of (we got internet at my house 2008-ish?), but even at the end of it, the internet was a Wild West. There was little to no corporate interest, just a bunch of nerds like myself launching their websites, and the tech industry producing it’s first couple of giants, which the world watched with peering eyes, but weren’t of the significance or importance as they are today. It was a naive and liberating place, not controlled by two or three big companies, like it is today. Online forums, dozens of proto-social media candidates, sprawling communities. Even as a child I wandered around the forums of the only MMORPG that could be played on my Pentium4 computer (Metin2) and made some good friends on IRC chats. Everything changed, when the advertisement nations attacked. In the second part of the 2010-s, YouTube became a sophisticated enough platform for more serious advertisement. That is good enough for showing advertisement for average or casual YouTube viewers, but you don’t really need a whole lot of tech savvyness to install an AdBlocker. So channels started to directly work directly with sponsors, which was and is more profitable for them and more direct and genuine for the consumer, being a better advertisement platform. This is both a good thing and a bad thing in my opinion. A good thing in the sense that a content creator does not rely solely on the mystical YouTube-AI which deems videos advertiser unfriendly left and right, but a bad thing in the sense that the same content creator becomes dependent on other, more direct third parties. This may or may not push them into accepting contracts in which not the ads are the means of producing videos, by financing this endeavor, but the videos become the shell to show these ads. This trend is not as strong as it is in the case of mainstream television, as individuals are harder to corrupt than established TV-stations. This shell state however is getting more and more popular because the way to fame and views (which leads to revenue) is through controversy and clickbait.

All caps title, a surprised or curious face of our content producer and a topic which at the surface level might even be of interest to us. We click on it, watch the whole ten minute video, which takes ages to reach to a conclusion, which isn’t at all groundbreaking in the slightest sense. We feel nothing at all. We learned nothing at all. We might have smiled or even laughed at some jokes, but we weren’t even entertained while watching this thing. There was nothing of particular value put into it, which couldn’t have been said or done by one of our friends next to a beer. This shallowness might not be intentional at all. But it makes the most sense, from a content producer’s perspective. If you’re doing this professionally, and rely on sponsorships it simply doesn’t really make sense to make very long, hard to produce videos. One off sponsor segments are worth more in high quantity, shorter videos, than many sponsor segments in a long one. Long, quality videos take a lot of work, and a lot energy to make. Not only this, but in order to make it watchable, you have to fill it with audio-visual stimulants, because we’ve been spoon-fed with these, just like with sugar. Take for example the Kurzgesagt channel. It is a truly amazing and noteworthy channel, but would it be interesting to so many people without it’s top notch animation? What if the audio quality would remain the same, the writing the same, and only the scope of visual representation would change, without reducing the amount of information. Would it be as successful, as it is now? And again, I’m not against these animations, I think they are wonderful, I’m just pointing out why they’re a symptom of our instant gratification filled world.This is not necessarily only the content producer’s fault. So far I’ve been pointing at the platform itself along with it’s creators, but it would be foolish to ignore the responsibility of the customer from this whole ordeal.

My reading comprehension hasn’t diminished significantly, but analyzing and understanding highly structural, complex and self-referencing texts has become harder for me. Another thing which I think was hurt by today’s social media landscape is my ability to pay attention at university classes. We’ve been accustomed to getting new types of impulses every few minutes with a different topic, and getting your brain bombarded with something substantially new and complex feels dangerous, in a way. One of my favorite channels is Cuck Philosophy. He mostly analyzes twentieth century philosopher’s in a thorough way, outlining their main ideas or contributions to general philosophic thought but also bringing forth their cultural significance. As much as I enjoy and like these videos, I often find myself not being able to reconstruct the train of thought presented to me. He does not use catchy thumbnails, does not cracks jokes, he makes content for the sake of content and education. It may also be a factor, that I’m not a philosophy major, nor am I very educated in this field, but I firmly believe, that had I continued my habit of reading (literature, and more complex non-fiction books, not those self-help improvement crapfests [about which I might write an article in the future]), I’d be more capable of receiving and processing information, along with a more structural train of thought.

The advantages of this approach as opposed to a non-static website is that the only HTTP request happens when the user loads in the page, making databases unneccesary, and making the whole website a lot faster.

Because of the vast space it encompasses, it does not feel like a vehicle, it feels like another moving world.

To be completely oblivious to your past, to not be crippled by anxiety of tomorrow: this is what I mean. And this isn’t only the case when I visit a new city, this happens every time I travel beetween my home town and my university town.

You can truly get into the state where you are completely disconnected from your everyday woes and problems, and could also get an outsider perspective on them. For example, I’m anxious about talking to my landlord, because my roommates have moved out, and I don’t know if I can keep the apartment for the summer, if I’m the only one paying for it. But here I am, fantasizing about getting a job in Italy or Germany, just for the sake of getting to know the historical parts of Europe.

Well of course, we all look at our phones, but once in a while we just can’t help but to strike a conversation with the person sitting one meter away from us. Well, I’m not doing that just right know, because I’m writing, but if I have that kind of traveling mate, it really could make the trip go so much easier. The most beautiful things about these friendships are the fact that they only exist on the train. Most probably you will never speak again with this person, nor will you see them ever again. It’s a precious magic, and we should appreciate the fact that it exists. After one of you arrives at his or her station you say goodbye, and after a few minutes it will seem like that you have only dreamed this whole thing, and your mind is playing tricks on you. It’s kind of like festival-friendships, with the difference that your background changes and moves without you taking drugs, which is pretty cost effective, if you ask me!

I’ve been on the DiscoverEU program with my pal last year, and I have to say, there was rarely a time when we were in awe because of the landscape we saw. The Czech Republic was especially bland, but the boring crown has to go the Netherlands: at first it was pretty astonishing to see just how FLAT can a piece of country get if it really sets itself to it, but after that initial reaction our emotions were replaced with the meh. Allow me to be patriotic about the nature of my homeland, because it is truly beautiful.

My father didn’t see the need for a car, nor were we in the situation financially to get one. So we “trained”, and boi, I don’t really regret it! My favourite types of trains were the ones with a second floor. I called them “froggy trains” for some reason, and I don’t really know why. I don’t remember sadly much of my pre-school childhood, which was a happy period of my life, but traveling by train somehow gives me some flashbacks about the things I’ve felt as a little human.

Especially if you’re surrounded by fellow students or just people who have business in some other city. This is sadly only possible on long distance trains. Local trains often smell of piss, and it’s travelers listen to garbage music loudly, without headphones, and drink beer out of plastic bottles. But setting that aside, these kinds of trips give the possibility of a meditative book reading experience. My favourite reads on train were Murakami Haruki’s short stories, and “The Red Haired Woman” by Orhan Pamuk.

It is my favorite mean of transportation, a strange mixture of a vehicle and a social space where you can be who you want to be, free from the pressure of the fast-paced reality which suffocates many of us from day to day. Or I’m just too poetic about it, and should get my lazy ass to finish driving school. Who knows? Maybe you do. Give me your input on this!
